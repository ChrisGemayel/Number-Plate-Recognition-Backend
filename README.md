# Number-Plate-Recognition-Backend
Backend server of a university project i did, it was for number plate recognition through Raspberry pies with cameras attached to them communicating with my back-end server. It was made on Node.js using Express. The back-end also serves a front end map made on React with authentication. The Database used is Mongodb through Mongoose. Communication with the Raspberry pies was done through mqtt

You must run the two python scripts i have added.

Modules that i've used:
